# Google Dorking Educational Tool

This project demonstrates how to use Google search operators (commonly referred to as **Google Dorking**) programmatically to perform advanced web searches. It allows users to input keywords and generate various search queries, which can be opened in a web browser or displayed in the terminal.

## Purpose

This tool is intended solely for **educational purposes** to teach the basics of Google Dorking, URL encoding, and how search engines can be used in more advanced ways. It is designed to help learners understand how search queries can be structured using operators like `inurl`, `intitle`, `allintext`, and others.


## Features

- Allows users to input primary and secondary keywords for advanced Google search queries.
- Supports Google search operators such as `inurl`, `intitle`, and `allintext`.
- Option to display search results in the terminal or open them directly in a web browser.
- Handles encoding of search queries to ensure they work correctly in URLs.

## Requirements

The tool is built using Python. To run it, you'll need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- `urllib.parse`
- `webbrowser`
- `time`

These libraries are included with Python by default, so you don't need to install them separately.
